# Hybrid-Event-Platform
This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Event Platform, which is a desktop-based platform for hosting hybrid events that combine both in-person and virtual components. The platform allows event organizers to create and manage their events, while also providing attendees with an interactive and immersive experience. This project proposal outlines the plan to create a conceptual and logical model, populate dummy data, create a database on MySQL with a defined schema, implement SQL using MySQL and NoSQL queries using MongoDB, and connect the MySQL database in Python to visualize and get insights on how the service can be improved.

## Tasks Performed
* Conceptual Model
* Logical Model
* Relational database
* CRUD 

## Dependencies
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* Python
* mysql-python connector
