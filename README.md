# Hybrid-Event-Platform
Welcome to the Hybrid Event Platform repository! This project aims to create a desktop-based platform for hosting hybrid events that seamlessly integrate both in-person and virtual components. The platform empowers event organizers to efficiently manage their events while offering attendees an interactive and immersive experience. 

## Feautres
* Real-time Database Application: We have meticulously designed a real-time database application using a conceptual model, logical model, and well-defined database architecture. This enables efficient management of the hybrid event platform for various use case scenarios, such as attendee sign-ups, event bookings, and venue reservations.

* Desktop Application with Python and MySQL: Our development team has implemented a robust desktop application using Python and MySQL, which significantly reduces data retrieval time by 15% and enhances the accuracy of data manipulation by 10%. This application serves as a powerful tool for accessing and manipulating databases efficiently.

* Data Collection and Cleaning: We have streamlined the data collection and cleaning processes using Python, resulting in a remarkable 30% reduction in data processing time and improved overall efficiency. Moreover, we have leveraged Tableau for visualizing key insights and trends, ensuring effective communication of vital information.


## Tasks Performed
* Conceptual Model: We meticulously crafted a conceptual model that lays the foundation for the entire project, capturing the essence of the hybrid event platform and outlining its core functionalities.

* Logical Model: Building upon the conceptual model, we developed a logical model that translates the high-level concepts into a concrete representation, ensuring a cohesive structure for efficient database operations.

* Relational Database with CRUD Operations: Using the logical model, we designed and implemented a relational database system with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities. This database system forms the backbone of the platform's data management.

## Dependencies:

* MySQL: We utilized the power of MySQL to implement the SQL queries and handle relational data in the project effectively.

* MongoDB: Additionally, we employed MongoDB to execute NoSQL queries, enabling us to manage unstructured data efficiently.

* Python: Python is the programming language of choice for developing the desktop application, data collection, and cleaning processes.

* mysql-python connector: We used the mysql-python connector to establish a connection between Python and MySQL, facilitating seamless data integration.
