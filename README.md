# Hybrid-Event-Platform
This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Event Platform, which is a desktop-based platform for hosting hybrid events that combine both in-person and virtual components. The platform allows event organizers to create and manage their events, while also providing attendees with an interactive and immersive experience. This project proposal outlines the plan to create a conceptual and logical model, populate dummy data, create a database on SQL with a defined schema, implement SQL using MySQL and NoSQL queries using MongoDB, and connect the MySQL database in Python to visualize and get analytics.

## Feautres
*	Designed a real-time database application using conceptual model, logical model and database architecture for efficient management of hybrid event platform for use case scenarios such as signing up, booking an event, booking for venues
*	Developed a desktop application using Python and MySQL for accessing and manipulating databases, which reduced the data retrieval time by 15% and increased the accuracy of data manipulation by 10%
*	Streamlined data collection and cleaning processes using Python, resulting in a 30% reduction in data processing time and improved efficiency, and leveraged Tableau to visualize key insights and trends for effective communication
